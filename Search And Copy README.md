"Search And Copy":
- Made as a support tool and a C# excercise. Used to search for specific phrases in tens of thousands of log files. 
- When the phrase is found, the program logs the file path and phrase found, and copies the file to specified folder.
- Similar programs exist and do a lot better job at it, but this program does good enough of a job for my specific needs.
- I will add more functionality as i come up with it.

Also, the program has a lot of room for experimentation and is a perfect place to try out new stuff as I learn it.
